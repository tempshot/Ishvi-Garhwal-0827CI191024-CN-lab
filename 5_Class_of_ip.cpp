Program Objective: To display the class of the IP Address entered by the user
Program 5: Write a program to display the class of the IP Address entered by the user.
Sample Input:
Enter the IP Address in Dotted Decimal Notation: 193.90.74.125
Enter the first octet: 193
Enter the second octet: 90
Enter the third octet: 74
Enter the fourth octet: 125
